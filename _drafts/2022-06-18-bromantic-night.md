On a corporate trip to Goa, with Akhil I spent the most quality time, he was always a go to person. He was always calling me, bro whether to go here or there or where not. When I was not in the party, he was like where is Bhavy, he called me right away and was like “Bho**** kahaan pe hai, dhokha de ke chala gaya”. He came back to my room to pick me up again. That is the true caring nature that one can think of. Yeah he speaks too much sometime but I like him as a friend. He is showing that much of an effort I will do the same for him. I will never forget his friendship, he is behaving like one true friend should behave, non pretentious, totally natural, caring attitude. He will always be on top priority list for me.

The most memorable moment with him was at night when we went to beach together, one thing that he suggested that I still remember is the night time I spent with him. He wanted to go to beach as the next day he would have left, although I was feeling sleeping but still I agreed to have a different experience at full moon night at the shore. This was a private beach and nobody was there and the view was absolutely mesmerizing. . I still remember his quotation on Instagram “The metaphysical nothing I want eventually”, actually initially I told him that how good the whole view with full moon, sea and total darkness look like. It almost looks like metaphysical and beyond this world. He right away thought of a quotation and posted on Instagram, with the following pic.
