I have been tested positive with covid, although no genomic sequencing is done but most probably it is due to omicron variant only which is sweeping across all over the world including India. Also I was vaccinated with both the doses of Covishield (Adenovirus based) vaccine. The cases are mostly supposed to be mild but how does a mild symptoms looks like, here is a day wise report of symptoms

-	Day 0: High fever 3 times in a day, 102 103F, bodyache, shivers, headache, runny nose, SpO2 level 97-98
-	Day 2: Moderate fever 2 times 100 F, less headache, shiver, SpO2 level 97-98
-	Day 3: No fever, no headache, only runny nose, but still feeling fatigue, PCR came +ve with Ct value of 25, SpO2 level 97-98
-	Day 4: No major symptoms, very less fatigue left


#### What medicines I took?

This was as per my GP recommendation, I am not recommending anyone anything, reach out to your doctor before taking any meds.
-	Azythromycine 1 tab each for 5 days
-	Paracetamol 600 Mg 
-	Montelukast for 3 days


#### A Note on Food

I ate very light diet mostly Daal and roti for 3 days, donâ€™t have very heavy food because your body might require more energy to digest heavy food. I took plenty of water. In terms of fruit I only ate Apple and Chiku. Also don't forget to take plenty of sleep and rest.
