1. **Style Fusion:** Mix and match different artistic styles. For example, prompt the AI to blend Michelangelo with anime or Rococo with steampunk.

2. **Incorporating Lighting Prompts:** Use words like dramatic, volumetric, cinematic, or studio lighting. For instance, add magic lighting prompts to enhance an image of a cat in mid-journey.

3. **Detail Enhancement:** Ask for high resolution or use adjectives like insanely detailed or intricately detailed. For example, request an image with super detailed fur on a cat.

4. **Texture Description:** Add texture descriptors such as rough, smooth, polished, translucent, feathery, matte, or knobbly. This can change the whole look of the image. For instance, ask for an image of a cat with a feathery texture.

5. **Non-Traditional Images:** Use screenshots of sound waves or other unconventional images as prompts. This can lead to unique results.

6. **Repeating Patterns:** Prompt for seamless repeating patterns using the "tile" command. For example, request a repeating tiled pattern that works well for a specific image.

7. **Beauty Enhancement:** Use the word "beautiful" to make the image smoother and highlight specific features. For instance, ask for an image with beautiful eyes or a cute face.

8. **Punking:** Add a punk attitude to images by combining it with various subjects. For example, request a kitten punk or dessert punk image.

9. **Juxtaposition:** Blend conflicting subjects, lighting, or backgrounds for creative results. This can create visually interesting images. For example, combine a serene background with dramatic lighting or contrasting subjects.

10. **Random Elements:** Add random letters, numbers, misspelled words, or punctuation to prompts. This can result in unexpected and whimsical images. For instance, include random punctuation and get an image of a robot made of cupcakes.

11. **Nonsense Words and Phrases:** Prompt with gibberish or nonsensical phrases. The AI may try to find meaning, leading to unexpected effects. For example, use nonsense words and get an image with a whimsical and surreal vibe.

12. **Emoji Prompts:** Instead of text, use emojis to create unique and fun images. For example, use an emoji of a monkey holding a banana to prompt an image of a monkey with a banana or a pineapple on a beach.
